# Open Quantum Safe with OpenSSL TLS1.3 handshake benchmarking

## Summary

* per signature algorithm s:
   * create new CA with signature algorithm
   * create new server keypair
   * create new certificate request for the CA
   * create new certificate signed by the CA
   * run the server with the newly created signed certificate
   * for each key exchange algorithm n:
   * run benchmark test on TLS client requesting nth key exchange algorithm
